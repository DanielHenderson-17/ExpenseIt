Expense It! is a front end React app I made that utilizes voice recognition, local storage, context api, and custom hooks. It is an expense tracker that has a very robust UI for desktop and mobile. User can speak or input the fields to add an income or expense to the page. User can delete transaction with voice or input as well. A graphical chart to represent the data being entered also shows up.
